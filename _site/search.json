Willingham, posted to bCourses.\nAfterwards, please post to Ed your thoughts (a paragraph or two) on the reading selection. The questions below might be helpful to spur your thinking.\nPossible questions to address: 1. Does this reading resonate with your own experience or contrast with it? In what ways? 2. What are a few critiques one would make of the arguments presented? 3. How do the ideas present inform how you might change your teaching?\nIn place of posting a new comment, you can also reply to your fellow students‚Äô comments. Any engagement and input is welcome as long as it‚Äôs original and respectful.\n\n\nReflections\nThe topic for next class is ‚ÄúTeaching as a member of a team‚Äù, so in preparation, please reflect on the role you play as a (u)GSI in a paragraph for two for the question below. The second question is meant to be answered by your instructor, so please ask them for a few sentences about how they see the role of the GSI in their class.\nNote: if you know of other students in 375 that are also GSIing for the same class, coordinate your question so the instructor only has to answer once (and then send that answer around to your fellow GSIs). Also, if the instructor has spelled this out previous to you verbally or in writing, you‚Äôre welcome to transcribe that.\nIf possible, write your answer to 1 before hearing the instructor‚Äôs response in 2.\n\n1. From the GSI\nWhat do you think your role is as a GSI in the broader context of the course? What responsibilities do you have to your students? What responsibilities do you have towards your instructor?\n\n\n2. From the Instructor\nWhat do you see as the role of GSI in the broader context of the course? What responsibilities do they have to the students? What responsibilities do you have towards you?"

    "text": "The primary goal of this course is to help first-time GSI appointments become more confident, efficient, and effective teachers. It aims to build in students a curiosity to persistently question their practice: Why am I teaching this particular topic? What is the most important thing that my students learn? How do I know if my students have learned it? Why have I chosen to teach it in the this manner? Why are certain students engaged and succeeding and others not?\nThere are three integral elements to this course. In person class meetings are the core of the experience, when you will encounter new ideas and discuss them in the context of your current teaching. Weekly assignments are an opportunity to reflect on the ideas discussed in class as well as readings. Teaching observations will occur twice during the semester and give you the opportunity to observe a different classroom environment than your own and receive feedback about your own teaching."

References will be posted to the course website along with information on how to access them.\n\n\nAssignments\nAssignments generally contain two components: a reflection on the previous week and a discussion question around the reading for the following week. Your reflection on the previous week will generally be submitted as an individual assignment to bbCourses and your responses to the reading questions will be posted to the discussion forum.\n\n\nDiscussion forum\nOut-of-class communication for this course will be held on Ed. We will use this forum to host discussions about the readings for the week. It is also where you should turn to if you have a question about the course. Questions that concern sensitive and private topics should be sent as private message (these are readable only by course staff). All other questions should be posted as public notes to the forum so that course staff and fellow students can answer questions in a way that will be visible to others."

If you have Letters of Accommodations from the Disabled Students‚Äô Program or another authorized office, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements."
